PACE Fine Dining
----------------
This website is made for a fine dining restaurant called "PACE"
It is a minimalistic restaurant that means to deliver high quality food
to its customers.

This restaurant prides itself on its pre-determined menu, and requires
the privilage of being able to decide what the customers is going to have
for their meal.

This website will depict the attractive food and welcoming atmosphere the 
restaurant provides and at the same time, follow the restaurant's theme of
being minimalistic.

This website will allow potential customers to know everything about the
restaurant, allow them to reserve seats easily and provides them with
contacts where they can send their queries to be satisfied.

Design Process
---------
My rationale for this website is to make it intuitive and easy to use.
The NAV Bar is easily visible, and the buttons are straightforward.
My goal is for the website to have a minimalistic theme, so that it is easy
on the eyes and gives out more of a fancy impression, suitable for a fine
dining restaurant.
'Home' is the landing page.
'Menu'' is for the menu.
'Reserve' is a form to fill in for reserving a table.
'Contact' is lists all the ways to contact the restaurant.

Features
--------
The NAV Bar is on every page, and allows users to navigate from one page
to another easily. Clicking on the pages' respective names on the NAV
bar brings them to the webpage.

The pictures in the home page are interactable. When hovered over, it
enlarges slightly, allowing the user to view the picture more clearly and
helps the landing page look more aesthetically pleasing.

The menu page is simple and straightforward, with no other features that
may confuse the users, as it simply just displays the menu for the users
the browse.

The reserve page has a form, which takes in user inputs and processes 
them via javascript. The function in javascript is only called upon and
run when the "Submit" button is clicked. The form takes in the Name,
Phone Number, Pax, Date and Timeslot. When the customer's information
is successfully logged, an alert box would pop up displaying the message;
"Reservation Succesful", which the customer can then close by pressing the
"Ok" button. After taking in the information, the javascript creates an 
objects that would store the customer and reservation information.

The Contact page has multiple features. Firstly, it has straightforward
texts showing the Phone Number of the restaurant that users can call and
the email address of the restaurant. Secondly, there are multiple hyper-
links that when clicked on, brings the user to the social media account of
the restaurant on the respective social media platforms. The webpage also
has a star rating system, where users can input the number of stars they
want to give the restaurant out of 5. They do not need to click the stars
3 times to give 3 stars, they only need to click on the 3rd star and all
the stars behind it will automatically be checked. Lastly, the pictures
on this webpage also functions similarly to the home page's pictures, when
hovered over, it enlarges slightly with a smooth animation, allowing the
users to look at the pictures more clearly and making the wbepage look
more aesthetically pleasing.

Description and explanation
---------------------------
The colour theme is meant to be easy on the eyes, with a soothing grey for
the background and a big banner with the restaurant's logo made very visible
on every page of the website. The colour and font of the texts are also very
comfortable to look at, as I used a combination of the colors lightsalmon and
tan. These colors aren't too sharp or bright, just warm enough to stand out
from the grey background, making it very easy to look at.

The landing(home) page shows the restaurant's slogan and pictures of some of
the food the restaurant has produced. It is a page meant to entice the
visitors, thus it has no functionality.

The menu is set by the restaurant everyday. The customers can choose whether
to eat either the breakfast, lunch or dinner provided by the restaurant, but
cannot choose specific food items as the menu is pre-set by the retaurant
everyday. Each meal comes with a set price, the price being dependent on the
day and time at which the customers chose to dine at. This page also provides
the restaurant's location, nearest carpark and dress code.

The customers can easily book a table at the Reserve page, with an easy to fill
up form only requiring the customers name, contact number, Pax (right now it's up
to 2 due to Covid), Time and Date. After filling these fields up, they can click
on the submit button to send a reservation.

The Contact page gives the page's visitors the restaurant's contact details, like
it's email and phone number. It also provides links to the restaurant's various
social media, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. It also has a link that sends the
visitor to the restaurant's google page, where they can leave a review.
